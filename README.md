# CS383-AI

This is a repo describing some of the projects that I did in my Artificial Intelligence class while studying at UMass Amherst. If you would like access to the projects, please contact me.

Course Information:
- This course was taken in the Fall 2023 semester. This course was modeled directly after the AI course at UC Berkeley (http://ai.berkeley.edu)

- Course website: https://people.cs.umass.edu/~sniekum/classes/383-F23/desc.php

- It covered the topics ranging from basic uninformed search, to reinforced learning, to deep learning and ethics of AI.

- This projects of this course were organized in the style of a PacMan game, where "dots" were goals, ghosts were opponents, and various AI algorithms were used to beat the traditional PacMan game.
